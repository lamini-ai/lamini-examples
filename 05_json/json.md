# Guarantee Valid JSON Output with Lamini

Structured outputs are required to combine LLM outputs with code, e.g. to call a function with specific parameters.

In the past, engineers had to write custom parsers, which were complex, unreliable, and required re-engineering for each new model.

```code
from lamini import Lamini

llm = Lamini(model_name="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf")
llm.generate(
    "How old are you?",
    output_type={"age": "int", "units": "str"}
)
```
