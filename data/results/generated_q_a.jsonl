So all this -- and then in addition to that, cut other operating expenses that gives us the confidence that we can achieve the EBITDA target for the year. I would like to add to that, that we are expecting to increase partially the capacity utilization in our factories in the second half of the year. So this is also something that will help us, improve our margins.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nSo maybe asked another way, obviously a quarter ago, you were still -- the global growth acceleration plan, the headcount reduction, the reduction in capacity, all of those things were expected -- a part of the plan three months ago. However, three months ago, you weren't expecting as much of a softer sales backdrop and some of the additional headwinds -- tougher sales environment in Australia, Canada, the more competitive environment, those things you were not expecting and that, that hurt your performance or reduced your sales growth outlook. What I'm trying to get a sense of it, let's say you didn't have those incremental headwinds, would we be looking at a -- an increase in EBITDA guidance by a certain amount because obviously you are still expectin\n====================\n\nConsider the numbers in the transcript.

I will start by discussing our second quarter results. For the second quarter 2019, global revenue was $141.1 million compared to $139.2 million in the second quarter of last year, approximately half of the decline was attributable to an adverse affects impact of $3.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined by 2.9% compared to last year due to soft market conditions combined with more competitive markets, mainly in Australia and Canada along with lower performance in Ikea US. This was partially offset by improved performance in our core US business and continued strong momentum in the U.K.\nIn the United States, second quarter sales increased by 7% compared to the second quarter of 2018. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in our core US business which grew 12% year-over-year and was mainly linked to actions taken by the new North American leadership team. As Yuval mentioned, the net impact of tariffs imposed on Chinese quartz countertop imports to the US has been unfavorable to our global footprint. The final determination on tariffs was in June and was generally consistent with the preliminary duties imposed on -- in the second half of 2018.\nAs a result of the tariffs, we have seen a surge in imports to the US from other developing countries in particular, India and Turkey. Outside the US, other developed markets continue to be served by Chinese manufacturers at low price points as the global market is still adjusting to this new condition. We can say that we have experienced an adverse impact outside of the US which was more severe than I initially anticipated, particularly in Australia and Canada. To that point, in Australia, constant currency sales were down 12%. The decline was attributable to continued competition, mainly from Chinese manufacturers as I just mentioned. This was coupled with very soft housing and remodelling markets which remain effected by more rigid lending standards and increased mortgage rates.\nIn Canada, constant currency sales were down 11.6%, our performance was affected by softness in housing and remodeling markets, we have declining trends and housing completion, combined with more intense competition from Chinese imports. Sales in Israel, on a constant currency basis, were down 3.5% as we experienced lower volume, mainly due to challenging housing market conditions.\nIn Europe, constant currency sales grew 15.7% mainly reflecting continued strong momentum in the U.K. Revenue in the rest of the world was also impacted by the Chinese competition, discussed earlier and on a constant currency basis, it was down 27%.\nLooking at our second quarter P&L performance, adjusted gross margin was 27.3% compared to 32.4% in the prior year quarter and 25.3% in the first quarter of 2019. The lower year-over-year adjusted gross margin mainly reflects the increased manufacturing unit costs due to lower fixed cost absorption driven by lower capacity utilization and FX headwinds partially offset by lower raw material costs.\nAs we mentioned on our last earnings call, the second quarter of 2018 was our highest gross margin quarter in 2018, which we did not expect to repeat this quarter, primarily due to lower capacity utilization. Operating expenses for the second quarter benefited primarily from lower marketing and sales expenses compared to the prior year quarter in line with our more prudent spending policy. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $19.2 million, a margin of 13.6% compared to $24.6 million, a margin of 16.5% in the prior year quarter.

I will start by discussing our second quarter results. For the second quarter 2019, global revenue was $141.1 million compared to $139.2 million in the second quarter of last year, approximately half of the decline was attributable to an adverse affects impact of $3.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined by 2.9% compared to last year due to soft market conditions combined with more competitive markets, mainly in Australia and Canada along with lower performance in Ikea US. This was partially offset by improved performance in our core US business and continued strong momentum in the U.K.\nIn the United States, second quarter sales increased by 7% compared to the second quarter of 2018. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in our core US business which grew 12% year-over-year and was mainly linked to actions taken by the new North American leadership team. As Yuval mentioned, the net impact of tariffs imposed on Chinese quartz countertop imports to the US has been unfavorable to our global footprint. The final determination on tariffs was in June and was generally consistent with the preliminary duties imposed on -- in the second half of 2018.\nAs a result of the tariffs, we have seen a surge in imports to the US from other developing countries in particular, India and Turkey. Outside the US, other developed markets continue to be served by Chinese manufacturers at low price points as the global market is still adjusting to this new condition. We can say that we have experienced an adverse impact outside of the US which was more severe than I initially anticipated, particularly in Australia and Canada. To that point, in Australia, constant currency sales were down 12%. The decline was attributable to continued competition, mainly from Chinese manufacturers as I just mentioned. This was coupled with very soft housing and remodelling markets which remain effected by more rigid lending standards and increased mortgage rates.\nIn Canada, constant currency sales were down 11.6%, our performance was affected by softness in housing and remodeling markets, we have declining trends and housing completion, combined with more intense competition from Chinese imports. Sales in Israel, on a constant currency basis, were down 3.5% as we experienced lower volume, mainly due to challenging housing market conditions.\nIn Europe, constant currency sales grew 15.7% mainly reflecting continued strong momentum in the U.K. Revenue in the rest of the world was also impacted by the Chinese competition, discussed earlier and on a constant currency basis, it was down 27%.\nLooking at our second quarter P&L performance, adjusted gross margin was 27.3% compared to 32.4% in the prior year quarter and 25.3% in the first quarter of 2019. The lower year-over-year adjusted gross margin mainly reflects the increased manufacturing unit costs due to lower fixed cost absorption driven by lower capacity utilization and FX headwinds partially offset by lower raw material costs.\nAs we mentioned on our last earnings call, the second quarter of 2018 was our highest gross margin quarter in 2018, which we did not expect to repeat this quarter, primarily due to lower capacity utilization. Operating expenses for the second quarter benefited primarily from lower marketing and sales expenses compared to the prior year quarter in line with our more prudent spending policy. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $19.2 million, a margin of 13.6% compared to $24.6 million, a margin of 16.5% in the prior year quarter. This primarily reflects the lower gross margin compared to last year, partially offset by lower operating expenses.

Our full year gross margin should be roughly stable year-over-year despite lower expected revenue base. To formulate our outlook, we have used current FX rates and raw material prices change -- changes to FX, all raw material costs may impact our outlook as we move through the year.\nLooking beyond 2019. In May, we introduced our long-term margin goals. We have a range of initiatives in the works under the multi-year global growth acceleration plan. We have a clear path to improve our performance. These plans support our long term gross margin target of 32% to 35% and our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 17% to 18%. The primary drivers for margin improvement are expected to come from: sales growth, particularly in the US, where we expect to benefit from better ASP and product mix; higher capacity utilization of our production facilities; improved efficiencies from our global growth acceleration plan; and finally, introducing innovative products to accelerate growth and improve profitability.\nWe are encouraged that the actions we took in the second quarter have already yielded improvement in our margin and operating leverage. Our team's commitment, along with continued execution of our strategy through the global growth acceleration plan, gave us confidence, as we look forward.\nThank you and we are now ready to open the call for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you.

When you think about the reiteration of the EBITDA guidance. I'd love to get a sense of obviously, everything kind of offset each other, but -- relative to a quarter ago, if you can kind of give us a -- any type of quantification of what the EBIT, the incremental negative impact on EBITDA was from, some of the headwinds that you've discussed, like the softer sales backdrop, the more competitive backdrop that you're seeing as a result of that in Australia and Canada, maybe even in the US. And then offsetting that, maybe what some of the positives are that you're seeing that allowed you to maintain that full year EBITDA guidance.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Michael, it's Yuval.

As discussed today, our outlook factors in our expectation for soft global market conditions and the competitive environment to persist in many of our region outside the US during 2019. Specifically, we now expect that the softer-than-expected performance in Australia and Canada as well as in some of our indirect markets will continue for the remainder of the year.\nAs a reminder, the financial impact of our global growth acceleration plan is included in our outlook for 2019 and is intended to drive additional growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the coming years. In the US, we continue to expect stronger revenue growth in the second half of 2019, as the enhancements that we are making in our North America region will start yielding better results.

I mean, in the US, we saw a decline in IKEA this quarter as well, but the core business grew 12% and it came from K&B, in our retail side of the business and from [Phonetic] the new building, but not from their big books.\nDillard Watt -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nOkay, great.

The period, I can say that compared to last year, there was a small decline in the price, but I think it's not -- I mean, something that it's much more -- a much expected in this environment.\nGoing forward, the fact that we are going to grow in the US and this is where we see the growth coming. We expect to see better prices there, and then I think that overall mix is this -- in the US, it's better and we should expect the growth in the ASP once we grow more in the portion of the US is higher.\nMichael \n====================\n\nConsider the numbers in the transcript.

For the second quarter 2019, global revenue was $141.1 million compared to $139.2 million in the second quarter of last year, approximately half of the decline was attributable to an adverse affects impact of $3.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined by 2.9% compared to last year due to soft market conditions combined with more competitive markets, mainly in Australia and Canada along with lower performance in Ikea US. This was partially offset by improved performance in our core US business and continued strong momentum in the U.K.\nIn the United States, second quarter sales increased by 7% compared to the second quarter of 2018. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in our core US business which grew 12% year-over-year and was mainly linked to actions taken by the new North American leadership team. As Yuval mentioned, the net impact of tariffs imposed on Chinese quartz countertop imports to the US has been unfavorable to our global footprint. The final determination on tariffs was in June and was generally consistent with the preliminary duties imposed on -- in the second half of 2018.\nAs a result of the tariffs, we have seen a surge in imports to the US from other developing countries in particular, India and Turkey. Outside the US, other developed markets continue to be served by Chinese manufacturers at low price points as the global market is still adjusting to this new condition. We can say that we have experienced an adverse impact outside of the US which was more severe than I initially anticipated, particularly in Australia and Canada.

On a constant currency basis, revenue declined by 2.9% compared to last year due to soft market conditions combined with more competitive markets, mainly in Australia and Canada along with lower performance in Ikea US. This was partially offset by improved performance in our core US business and continued strong momentum in the U.K.\nIn the United States, second quarter sales increased by 7% compared to the second quarter of 2018. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in our core US business which grew 12% year-over-year and was mainly linked to actions taken by the new North American leadership team. As Yuval mentioned, the net impact of tariffs imposed on Chinese quartz countertop imports to the US has been unfavorable to our global footprint. The final determination on tariffs was in June and was generally consistent with the preliminary duties imposed on -- in the second half of 2018.\nAs a result of the tariffs, we have seen a surge in imports to the US from other developing countries in particular, India and Turkey. Outside the US, other developed markets continue to be served by Chinese manufacturers at low price points as the global market is still adjusting to this new condition. We can say that we have experienced an adverse impact outside of the US which was more severe than I initially anticipated, particularly in Australia and Canada.

We put a new team in place, we created the North American region. We took our best talent in the region and put them in the more senior positions. And I think we started to see the fruits or the improvements coming to -- to be in our side. All in all, it was -- in the past, it was our focus -- sorry, our guess of the market share in our view and I think it's -- it's too early to say whether say in a different position. Now, definitely what I can say is that we are more -- way more confident that we can capture the opportunity that that we've seen in the market in the US, and we're definitely going to see growth coming from the US business over the next quarters.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nAlright. One last one, if I could. I think you said that in the US, the imports -- the China -- the tariffs or duties on the China imports, -- Chinese imports in the US are fully in place, but did I hear right that you said that you're also now seeing maybe an increase in imports in India and Turkey and I just wanted to make sure, I heard that right, and if you could give us a sense if the amount of imports from those regions are equal to the prior amount of imports from China? Are they half of the amount of imports from China? Just trying to get a sense of how big that activity is, and to the extent that it's replacing any of the prior Chinese import activity?\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Mike. That's a very good point. We see a significant increase in the import from low cost manufacturers, specifically more in India -- from India, Turkey, but from others as well. In terms of the magnitude, if you look at the import data publishing -- import data from March, April, May, and compared it to the equivalent period. Last year, you see that there is a significant say, replacement of the Chinese import by, I wouldn't say why, but one by one, but it's pretty close to what was the to the level that was imported last year.\nSo I think that there is no vacuum here. I would say that, that the growth --- that's why we said that the growth that we see is more related to the actions that we are taking and the changes that they were made in the US organization under the new leadership there and as we said, we are planning to expand our footprint in the US because we think there is a really great opportunity for us in this -- in this market to grow in the coming years.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nAll right.

I want a follow up and ask a follow up on the India and Turkey and other countries that you're seeing import into the US. Is that a -- are you seeing similar -- either landed prices or retail or however you want to measure the price point, is it still -- is it still a pricing headwind that you were -- you had experience in the past with the Chinese competition that was pretty disruptive to the business?\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Dillard, it's it's Yuval. I think it's pretty much the same. We are -- from the data that we have, we are experiencing probably the similar price points coming from different locations. I guess, -- the change from China to India is actually in the same segment with the same prices. So obviously, average price, so it's -- it has -- these are accuracy measurement, but all in all I think normal I think, you'll see the same -- same behavior in the market. There's no shortfall of the low cost manufacturing slabs or sources in the US and again, I think it's -- it's mostly what we are doing internally in our business to capture the opportunity rather than less of competition.\nDillard Watt -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. And then I hate to belabor the point too much here on the various low cost competition, but if it's coming in now to Canada, Australia, does they have benefit -- a little bit of some mix of hindsight and experience from what has occurred in the US, -- what might be the strategy to offset some of the volume pressures in those other countries at the same time that you're having some macro pressures there.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think what we're experiencing is more competition in Australia and Canada, mostly in the commercial area with the high rise building and multi-units. This is where -- it's more price sensitive and we see more competition coming. It's only partial or part of our portfolio in those countries and I think we continue to build on our very strong Caesarstone brand in those countries we are very strong with, consumers and the K&B shops. And I think we'll continue to work on, on the demand throughout coming in this -- in this market.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd to add to that, it's really -- when you look at the Australian housing market, it's a very soft market conditions that combined with the competition, gets us to that result, but need to take that into consideration, that the market conditions are pretty soft.\nDillard Watt -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nYeah.

It's actually allowed us to put quite many projects together in order to speed up the improvement and efficiencies in our company. And I think what we got from the first quarter, the second one is a nice tailwind, if you like, to allow us to, to absorb this reduction in revenue. So all in all, I think we're growing the US and we have more and more challenging times in Australia and Canada. But the actions we took in the first quarter, across-the-board, in all over the -- in the company, in all functions and regions, kind of allowing us to -- to kind of bit more confident with EBITDA performance for year.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And just to complete, we reduced the headcount by 7% as we announced, the part of it was temporarily reducing the capacity in our Richmond Hill facility in the US to 50%. So all this -- and then in addition to that, cut other operating expenses that gives us the confidence that we can achieve the EBITDA target for the year. I would like to add to that, that we are expecting to increase partially the capacity utilization in our factories in the second half of the year. So this is also something that will help us, improve our margins.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nSo maybe asked another way, obviously a quarter ago, you were still -- the global growth acceleration plan, the headcount reduction, the reduction in capacity, all of those things were expected -- a part of the plan three months ago. However, three months ago, you weren't expecting as much of a softer sales backdrop and some of the additional headwinds -- tougher sales environment in Australia, Canada, the more competitive environment, those things you were not expecting and that, that hurt your performance or reduced your sales growth outlook. What I'm trying to get a sense of it, let's say you didn't have those incremental headwinds, would we be looking at a -- an increase in EBITDA guidance by a certain amount because obviously you are still expecting all those benefits and they just got offset by these incremental headwinds. So I'm just trying to get a quantification of what that difference was?\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, so, first -- there are different dynamics here from FX rates to prices of raw materials, that also changed and provided some headwind, a tailwind. So if you were look at that. I think that we also identified some things that were less clear to us that we can achieve in this year and we will manage to have a clearer path on achieving them this year and we have more confidence that we can achieve more efficiencies in our operating expenses and hence, we think that, this is achievable.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd also, Mike, in terms of organizational behavior, if you like.

I think those share positions were kind of last published in the last couple of years, just trying to get a sense of, how you think about your updated, your current competitive position in the marketplace, I mean, over the last couple of years, the marketplace has changed dramatically, maybe you could kind of walk through by channel where you think your position from a share standpoint? Who are the other major competitors? And why you think you can -- I am -- I am assuming obviously over the last couple of years, the market has grown perhaps you've lost a little bit of share. How you're thinking about regaining that share.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt's good comment, Michael. I think, it's been a few quarters that, and maybe more, but we are saying to the market and to ourselves, that most of our current performance in the US are in our hands to improve and to work on, and I think that is what happening in the last quarter or two. We put a new team in place, we created the North American region. We took our best talent in the region and put them in the more senior positions. And I think we started to see the fruits or the improvements coming to -- to be in our side. All in all, it was -- in the past, it was our focus -- sorry, our guess of the market share in our view and I think it's -- it's too early to say whether say in a different position. Now, definitely what I can say is that we are more -- way more confident that we can capture the opportunity that that we've seen in the market in the US, and we're definitely going to see growth coming from the US business over the next quarters.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nAlright. One last one, if I could. I think you said that in the US, the imports -- the China -- the tariffs or duties on the China imports, -- Chinese imports in the US are fully in place, but did I hear right that you said that you're also now seeing maybe an increase in imports in India and Turkey and I just wanted to make sure, I heard that right, and if you could give us a sense if the amount of imports from those regions are equal to the prior amount of imports from China?

As part of this plan and as previously announced in May, we completed a global headcount reduction of approximately 7% across all our business units to improve our efficiencies and cost structure in a range of areas.\nIn conjunction with these actions, we reduced effective capacity in our US manufacturing facility by 50%. We work to improve our performance and refine our production strategy to increase efficiency and optimize our inventory as already reflected in our results. We are managing a global growth acceleration plan under 10 work streams, covering all aspects of our business, from innovation, production and supply chain to our brand and go-to market. I'm excited with the unified determination of our team to drive improvement in our business through these projects.\nAs part of realignment of our North American operation earlier this year, our progress is evident from encouraging results in our core business in the US which grew 12% year-over-year. We are in the process of significantly expanding our US. sales force to further improve our presence in large underrepresented metropolitan areas. We expect to keep expanding the US sales force through 2020 as we see great potential in these markets and expect a high return on our investment. Regarding tariffs, our global markets are adjusting to the new conditions following the final resolution on imported quartz countertops from China to the US. These newly imposed duties have adversely impacted our markets outside the US, mainly in Australia and Canada, that have seen a more competition coming from China.\nThe impact was greater than it's anticipated and resulted in a softer than expected performance during the second quarter, while the expected benefits of our initiatives give us confident in achieving our full-year EBITDA outlook for 2019, we adjusted our expectations from revenue to reflect a more competitive environment than originally anticipated.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with the overall progress that we saw in our initiatives during the second quarter.

Could I get a sense of what your price mix was or average sales price this quarter versus last quarter versus a year ago?\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nWhen you when you look at the ASP, you need to take into consideration that it's, the combination of mix -- regional mix, the product mix and of course, it's affected by the different foreign exchange rates between the quarter. The period, I can say that compared to last year, there was a small decline in the price, but I think it's not -- I mean, something that it's much more -- a much expected in this environment.\nGoing forward, the fact that we are going to grow in the US and this is where we see the growth coming. We expect to see better prices there, and then I think that overall mix is this -- in the US, it's better and we should expect the growth in the ASP once we grow more in the portion of the US is higher.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nI appreciate that.

Maybe one -- other one while you're looking at that. The IKEA business has obviously been a lot of volatility -- a source of a lot of volatility. In the last couple of years, I think both in the US and most notably, but also Canada to a -- to a secondary extent. I was just trying to get a sense of what percent of the -- roughly what percent of the business in the US and in number one and secondly in Canada, what, what does IKEA represent as a percent of the business? And, is this a partner that makes sense strategically given all the volatility?\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nJust before the numbers, Michael, I guess the fact that they're growing in their core business, I think gives a hint on where we are putting our focus and it's definitely -- everything that is in our hands and the relationship that we can build with consumers and customers is where we are putting our focus and resources. And yes, I think that the IKEA revenue keeps being volatile and we see that growth in this quarter as well. So, yeah, we are reporting on that, it's still part of our business, but definitely there our focus is on the retail side of the business.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, as for the percentage, it's a -- it's less than 10% of our overall revenues as a company and provide us a good, our profitability and it's good business for us, but it's, less than 10% of our overall business.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nLadies and ge", "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You are a financial analyst with extensive experience at Goldman Sachs.You are reading the earnings call transcript for the following company:\n\n====================\n\nCompany: NASDAQ: CSTE\nTicker: CSTE\nDate: Aug 7, 2019, 8:30 a.m. ET\nQuarter: 2019-Q2\n====================\n\nYou are reading the following section of the earnings call transcript:\n\n====================\n\ncutive Officer\nSo, no formal news at the moment.
