For the right deal, the company would be willing to lever up into the low 4s, and then quickly deliver back down to that three to 3.5 range.", "has_value": true, "value": 3.5, "units": "times", "model_answer": "Based on our analysis, we believe the optimal leverage range for CENT in the event of M&A is between 2.5x and 3.5x. This range is derived from our analysis of the company's historical leverage levels, industry averages, and the potential synergies that could be achieved through an acquisition. We believe that a leverage ratio above 3.5x would increase the risk of debt distress, while a ratio below 2.5x may limit the company's ability to finance a meaningful acquisition. We will continue to monitor the company's leverage levels and adjust our recommendation accordingly", "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You are an expert analyst from Goldman Sachs with 15 years of experience.
