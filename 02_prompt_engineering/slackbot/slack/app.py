        "answer": "6C40.71",
        "context": "Alcohol induced anxiety disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that is caused by or related to alcohol use. It is characterized by symptoms such as excessive worry, fear, or panic attacks that are triggered by the use of alcohol. These symptoms can interfere with the person's daily life and may lead to avoidance of social situations or other activities that involve alcohol.\n\nAlcohol induced anxiety disorder is a relatively rare condition, but it can be serious if left untreated. It is important for individuals who are experiencing symptoms of this disorder to seek professional help from a healthcare provider, such as a psychiatrist or therapist, who can evaluate their symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.\n\nTreatment for alcohol induced anxiety disorder typically involves a combination of therapy and medication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be effective in helping individuals learn coping strategies and change negative thought patterns that contribute to their anxiety. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines may also be prescribed to help manage symptoms.\n\nIt is important to note that alcohol induced anxiety disorder is just one type of anxiety disorder and that there are many other types of anxiety disorders that may be diagnosed based on a person's symptoms. It is always best to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan."

This can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, inflammation, liver disease, and certain medications. Symptoms of hepatomegaly may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and eyes).\n\nIt is important to note that swelling of the liver can be a serious condition and should be evaluated by a healthcare provider. A healthcare provider may perform a physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies to determine the cause of the hepatomegaly and develop an appropriate treatment plan."

Insulin is a hormone that is produced by the pancreas and is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes due to a genetic defect in insulin secretion, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the insulin that is produced is not effective at regulating blood sugar levels.\n\nSymptoms of diabetes due to a genetic defect in insulin secretion may include frequent urination, increased thirst, fatigue, and blurry vision. It is important to note that this type of diabetes is typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and is often associated with other genetic disorders.\n\nTreatment for diabetes due to a genetic defect in insulin secretion typically involves a combination of insulin therapy, dietary changes, and physical activity. In some cases, other medications or surgical procedures may also be used to manage the condition."
