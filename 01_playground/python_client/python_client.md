# Python Client

It is straightforward to call a LLM from python using Lamini.

First, get `<YOUR-LAMINI-API-KEY>` at [https://app.lamini.ai/account](https://app.lamini.ai/account).

Add the key as an environment variable. Or, authenticate via the Python library below.

```bash
export LAMINI_API_KEY="<YOUR-LAMINI-API-KEY>"
```

Install the Python library.

```python
pip install lamini
```

Run an LLM with a few lines of code.

```python
import lamini

llm_runner = lamini.LlamaV2Runner()
print(llm_runner.call("How are you?"))
```

Instead of the environment variable, you can also pass your key in Python:

```python
lamini.api_key = "<YOUR-LAMINI-API-KEY>"
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
