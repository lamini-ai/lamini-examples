        "# Memory Tuning Example 🦙\n",
        "Memory Tuning is a powerful feature offered by Lamini that enables effective fact memorization. While it's user-friendly, the process requires iteration. In this example, we'll walk you through the process of creating a model that can accurately answer questions about [Lamini's Python library](https://github.com/lamini-ai/lamini/blob/c1d52643dd129841bf508c1fb09721cafebeab67/lamini/api/lamini.py).

In some cases, brute chunking can inadvertently cut off words or sentences, resulting in poor-quality data. To mitigate this, consider implementing smarter chunking strategies, such as chunking at the end of each paragraph or section, tailored to your specific data.\n",
