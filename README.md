# Lamini SDK

In this SDK, we include three tutorials for achieving high-quality results with Language Models (LLMs) using Lamini.

1. [Playground] - TODO, add link and description
2. [Prompt Engineering](https://github.com/lamini-ai/sdk/blob/main/02_prompt_engineering/prompt_engineering.md) - crafting and refining input queries or instructions to achieve desired responses from language models.
3. [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://github.com/lamini-ai/sdk/blob/main/03_RAG/rag.md) - combining information retrieval with text generation to improve language models.
4. [Instruction Fine Tuning (IFT)](https://github.com/lamini-ai/sdk/blob/main/04_IFT/ift.md) - refining language models through targeted adjustments to improve performance on specific tasks.
