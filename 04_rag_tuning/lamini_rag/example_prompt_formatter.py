    Class used to encapsulate the test data used in this example.
        -- /app/lamini-earnings-sdk/data/golden_test_set.jsonl
    This class contains a few methods for handling and building 
    testing prompts used after the RAG index has been built (or loaded).

    This is separate from the DataLoader as that is expected to be used
    for RAG index building, this class is a handler to help with building
    queries to be used in the model evaluation stage.

    While having a class like this is helpful to ensure data encapsulation
    with functions acting on such data. It is not required when using a pipeline.

    Parameters
